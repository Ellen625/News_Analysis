I found out at the optometry that I had a viral eye infection and were given steroid drops.  Now, every now and then, my eyes would get the same symptoms but only lasts a day or two. I normally wear contacts, but on those days, my eyes would burn if I try to put them in so I would stick to glasses. Is this a viral infection?  I know I need to see a doctor, but I've been very busy with classes and work, but I just want to have an idea of what is wrong with my eyes... Thanks in advance.
